# A Micro-Manual for LISP - Not the whole truth

A neatly typeset version of John McCathy's classic paper "A Micro-Manual for
LISP - Not the whole truth".

The [original](https://cse.sc.edu/~mgv/csce330f15/micromanualLISP.pdf) is a very
poorly typeset PDF and text cannot be copied. This aims to be a verbatim copy of
the original, character by character. Any deviation unless explicitly noted is a
bug.
